I like that George Mason offers an inclusive campus that is offers a great space to learn for people of all races. George Mason is a Very diverse school and I love it. Overall, they have great teachers and students. An area they could improve on would be giving their students more scholarship opportunities. There aren't many offered by the school themselves.
I am currently doing online school with George Mason, and it has been working really well for me! The professors are responsive and knowledgable, and they are always there to help me out. Unfortunately due to COVID, I have not been able to go on campus very often. However, the few times I have gone, it is very beautiful, clean, and has a lot of amenities available to students. I would definitely recommend this college to others.
I love how very inclusive the campus is. They encourage you to do your best and they send out emails for scholarships and internship opportunities. I would highly recommend this school to anyone who loves to explore new things and to be involved in activities. They have such a great atmosphere that makes you feel welcomed. I'm so glad to be a George Mason Patriot!
